No diffs

1.  No diff after stripping
2.  No diff after removing debug
4.  Only two sha256sum's differ (Useless now, remove)
5.  artix-meson vs arch-meson
6.  artix-cmake vs cmake
7.  DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr  (Lots of Qt pkgs. Prefix is /usr anyway)
8.  echo vs msg2
9.  DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr
10. srcdir semantics
11. License file diff
